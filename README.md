# Kinect_SLAM
This  project written just for Tutorial , learning other scholars' algothrim, it is based on the opengl ,QT5,ROS. this V-SLAM's main algorithm referenced to the ORB-SLAM, I use its LoopClosing,Optimization and So on ,in addition, some noisy model of kinect v1 also added to this project,Such as EMM, a function which compute the mahalanobis distance between the coordinate of the same MapPoints in two different frame,judge the  quality of the motion between two keyframes.

its a unfinished project 
problems remained to be conquered
